# iheartjane-menu-display
 Displays a specific iheartjane store menu based on a URL location id query (.e.g /?location=XXXX). If no location query is available, the operator embed will be loaded instead. Jane's operator embed displays store based on zip code.

 This allows for a site to host multiple iheartjane menus with a single embed code (instead of having separate pages for each menu). The use case for this is for allowing the user to select from a list of stores and/or allowing the user to input their own zip code.
